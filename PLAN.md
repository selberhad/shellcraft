## Phase 1: DSL Extensions (Foundation)

### 1.a DSL Test: Filesystem assertions
**File:** `test/00_dsl_filesystem.t`
- Write test for `expect_file_exists()`, `expect_dir_exists()`, `expect_file_contains()`
- Test positive and negative cases
- Verify assertions fail when conditions not met

### 1.b DSL Impl: Filesystem assertions
**File:** `test/GameTest.pm`
- Add methods:
  - `expect_file_exists($path)` - Check file exists
  - `expect_dir_exists($path)` - Check directory exists
  - `expect_file_contains($path, $pattern)` - Grep file for pattern
  - `create_file($path, $content)` - Helper to create test files

---

### 2.a DSL Test: Command execution
**File:** `test/00_dsl_commands.t`
- Write test for `run_command()` that executes shell commands
- Test command success/failure, output capture
- Verify command output can be inspected

### 2.b DSL Impl: Command execution
**File:** `test/GameTest.pm`
- Add methods:
  - `run_command($cmd)` - Execute shell command, return success/output
  - `expect_command_success($cmd)` - Assert command exits 0
  - `expect_command_fails($cmd)` - Assert command exits non-zero
  - `get_command_output($cmd)` - Return stdout from command

---

### 3.a DSL Test: DM tick simulation
**File:** `test/00_dsl_dm_tick.t`
- Write test for `trigger_dm_tick()` that calls dungeon-master --tick
- Verify it can be called from tests
- Handle permission issues gracefully

### 3.b DSL Impl: DM tick simulation
**File:** `test/GameTest.pm`
- Add method:
  - `trigger_dm_tick()` - Execute `/usr/sbin/dungeon-master --tick`
- Handle cases where DM might not have permissions
- Reload player state after tick (soul.dat may have changed)

---

## Phase 2: L2 Quest - The Crack (Hidden Directory)

**Quest:** Discover hidden `.crack/` directory in `/sewer` using `ls -a`

### 4.a L2 Test: Quest discovery
**File:** `test/07_quest_the_crack.t`
- Player at L2 has `ls -a` unlocked
- Run `ls -a` in `/sewer`, verify `.crack/` is listed
- Cannot see `.crack/` without `-a` flag
- Can `cd` into `.crack/`
- Find quest marker or clue file inside

### 4.b L2 Impl: World population
**Files:** `docker/game-image/init/populate_world.sh` or init script
- Create `/sewer/.crack/` directory during world initialization
- Add `.crack/.clue` file with flavor text
- Rebuild game image
- Verify test passes

---

## Phase 3: L3 Quest - The Locked Door

**Quest:** Create a `key` file to unlock a door, DM transforms door into Under-Nix portal

### 5.a L3 Test: Door discovery
**File:** `test/08_quest_locked_door.t`
- Player at L3 enters `/sewer/.crack/`
- Find `locked_door` file (plaintext, not executable)
- `cat locked_door` shows: "This lock looks like it needs a key to be unlocked. Obviously."
- Player has `touch` command unlocked at L3
- Verify cannot enter locked_door (it's a file, not directory)

### 5.b L3 Impl: Door file creation
**Files:** `docker/game-image/init/populate_world.sh`
- Add `locked_door` file to `/sewer/.crack/` during world init
- File contains hint text about needing a key
- Verify test passes (discovery part)

---

### 6.a L3 Test: Key creation and door transformation
**File:** `test/08_quest_locked_door.t` (continuation)
- Player runs `touch key` or `touch .key` in `.crack/`
- Save game (to persist key file)
- Trigger DM tick
- DM detects key file, transforms `locked_door` file → `under_nix/` directory
- Player can now `cd under_nix`
- Original `locked_door` file is gone

### 6.b L3 Impl: DM door transformation logic
**File:** `docker/game-image/dungeon-master.pl`
- Add `check_locked_door()` function
- Check if `/sewer/.crack/key` or `/sewer/.crack/.key` exists
- If exists:
  - Remove `locked_door` file
  - Create `under_nix/` directory
  - Populate `under_nix/` with symlink maze structure
  - Remove key file (consumed)
- Call from main DM tick
- Verify test passes

---

## Phase 4: L4 Quest - The Symlink Maze (Discovery)

**Quest:** Discover that `ls -R` hangs on circular symlinks, realize need for better tools

### 7.a L4 Test: Maze discovery
**File:** `test/09_symlink_maze_discovery.t`
- Player at L4 has `ls -R` unlocked
- Enter `/sewer/.crack/under_nix/`
- Try `ls -R`, command hangs on circular symlinks
- Test uses timeout (e.g., `alarm()` or backgrounding)
- Verify player can Ctrl+C / kill the process
- Quest objective: "Realize the maze is unsolvable with current tools"

### 7.b L4 Impl: Symlink maze creation
**File:** `docker/game-image/dungeon-master.pl` or helper script
- Create `create_symlink_maze()` function
- Build maze structure with circular symlinks:
  - Example: `a -> b`, `b -> c`, `c -> a`
- Include in door transformation logic (6.b)
- Maze should have multiple dead ends and one correct path
- Verify test passes (with timeout handling)

- Quest: "Create a portal from /home to under_nix for quick access"
- Navigate to `/sewer/.crack/under_nix/` (confirm it exists)
- Run: `ln -s /sewer/.crack/under_nix /home/portal`
- Verify symlink works: `cd /home/portal` takes you to under_nix
- `ls -l /home/portal` shows `->` pointing to under_nix
- Save game, trigger DM tick
- DM awards quest XP (e.g., 300 XP)
- Quest removed from active quests

**File:** `test/11_navigate_maze.t`
- Player at L6 has `ls -l` unlocked
- Enter `/sewer/.crack/under_nix/`
- Use `ls -l` to see symlink targets: `link_a -> ../room2/`
