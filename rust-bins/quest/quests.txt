%% QUEST 1

name=The Sewer Cleanse
min_level=0
reward_xp=1000
offer_title=The Sewer Cleanse
offer_narrative="""
The garbage collection zones are overrun. Corrupted processes
scurry through /sewer, remnants of programs that refused to die
cleanly. The system's immune response has failed. These .rat files
must be purged manually, one by one, before they consume what little
memory remains.
"""
offer_objective=Eliminate all rats in /sewer

journal_description="""
The garbage collector has failed. /sewer is infested with
orphaned process remnants. Purge them all.

%% QUEST 2
id=2
name=The Crack
min_level=2
reward_xp=2000
offer_title=The Crack
offer_narrative="""
The walls of the filesystem are not as solid as they appear.
There are places where the permissions have worn thin, where
dotfiles whisper of deeper layers. The old phreakers spoke of
finding cracks in systems—not to destroy, but to explore what
was always there, just hidden. What does /sewer conceal?
"""
offer_objective=Discover the hidden .crack/ directory in /sewer
offer_reward=2000 XP
journal_description="""
Find the hidden directory in /sewer. Not all paths are visible
to those who look without the -a flag.
"""
journal_objective=Discover the .crack/ directory
journal_reward=2000 XP

%% QUEST 3
id=3
name=The Locked Door
min_level=3
reward_xp=3000
offer_title=The Locked Door
offer_narrative="""
Beyond the crack lies a sealed inode, locked with permissions
you cannot yet bypass. But locks are just files pretending to be
barriers. The door expects a specific pattern—a .key file with
the right magic bytes. Social engineering for filesystems.
Create the key. Convince the door you belong here.
"""
offer_objective=Create a key and unlock the door in .crack/
offer_reward=3000 XP
journal_description="""
A locked door in /sewer/.crack/ blocks deeper access.
The door expects a .key file. Forge it.

%% QUEST 4
id=4
name=Portal Home
min_level=5
reward_xp=8000
offer_title=Portal Home
offer_narrative="""
You've found Under-Nix—the layer beneath the layer, the world
below the world. But traveling through /sewer every time is
tedious. The old sysadmins knew the truth: distance is an illusion
in a filesystem. Space and time collapse into inodes and pointers.
Create a symbolic link—a wormhole through the directory tree.
Bend space. Make /home know about the depths.
"""
offer_objective=Create a symlink from /home to under_nix
offer_reward=8000 XP
journal_description="""
Link /sewer/.crack/under_nix to /home/portal for instant access.
The ln command bends space itself.

%% QUEST 5
id=5
name=Navigate the Maze
min_level=6
reward_xp=13000
offer_title=Navigate the Maze
offer_narrative="""
Under-Nix is not a place. It's a knot of references, a maze
of pointers pointing to pointers. The Wyrm dreams here, they say,
and its dreams are recursive. Paths fold back on themselves.
Directories that lead nowhere and everywhere. But somewhere in
this tangle of symlinks lies something real—a treasure the maze
was built to hide. Follow the arrows. Trust nothing but 'ls -l'.
"""
offer_objective=Find the treasure in the symlink maze

The symlink labyrinth in under_nix conceals a treasure.
Navigate the maze. Let 'ls -l' reveal the true paths.
